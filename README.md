# Restaurant-Rating-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Pipeline
Developed an optimized regression pipeline to predict restaurant aggregate ratings, achieving high accuracy (RÂ² from cross-validation) by automating data preprocessing and feature selection in Python. Built a Gradient Boosting Regressor by handling outliers (IQR method), encoding categorical features (OneHot & Ordinal), imputing missing values (mean/most-frequent), and scaling numerical features (StandardScaler). Selected the top 10 predictive features using SelectKBest (f_regression) and fine-tuned hyperparameters (n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth) via GridSearchCV, leading to an optimized model serialized with pickle for efficient deployment
